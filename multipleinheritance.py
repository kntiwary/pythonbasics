# In the multiple inheritance scenario, any specified attribute is searched first in the current class.
# If not found, the search continues into parent classes in depth-first,
# left-right fashion without searching same class twice.

# This order is also called linearization of MultiDerived class and the set of
# rules used to find this order is called Method Resolution Order (MRO).
